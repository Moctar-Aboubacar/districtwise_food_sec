# conclusion
## As feared, our survey design is adapted to the ecological belt, and is not good for producing results at the district level. How about by strata?
# test if we looked at different strata from the survey only.
# result: 95% CIs of about 5-7 FCS points. Much tigher. Makes sense as the sample is much bigger. Still there is a lot of overlap... our survey isn't that precise darn...
